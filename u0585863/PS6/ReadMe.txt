10/15/2018  Starting building the GUI, then watched a lecture I had missed and saw the Kopta had done a better job then I did, so
started over.

10/19/2018 Decent functionality, duplication issues.  I think I want to try doing cell border color the extra feature.

10/20/2018 It wasn't duplication it was a Row/Col assignment issue.  Additionally Regex had to be modified.

10/21/2018 Got the selection event working and the set button/accept button functionality working. Having issues with Open
and I don't understand what the XML error is telling me.  I thought it was working from PS5/4 apparently not. Reviewed Spreadsheet Panel
and decided that a simpler extra feature(s) would be better. More time to test/edit code. Also tried fixing PS5, still nothing.

10/22/2018 Going to talk to the TA's today(check hours) to see if they can see what is wrong with open.

(If source code is needed I can provide it, was just easier to embed the exe, one line of code)
The connect four.exe is just stored at the root because I was using the .resx manager but added stuff in the wrong place....didn't 
know what I was doing, spent quite a bit of time cleaning up file structure and weird errors.

Extra Features: Red text, A new form explaining the extra features that closes with the spreadsheetForm, a console game for when you get
tired of writing spreadsheets at work. A synthesizer because Kopta mentioned something about it in class once and I wanted to know
more.
